# Configure DNS

UbuntuCE comes pre-configured with web content filtering powered by [CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/). In our tests [CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/) provided the best protection.

**If you want to switch to another supported DNS provider you can use [DNS Minder](https://github.com/jeremehancock/dnsminder#readme).**

DNS Minder allows you to enable [CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/), [OpenDNS FamilyShield](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield), [1.1.1.1 for Families](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/), or [AdGuard Family DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html).
