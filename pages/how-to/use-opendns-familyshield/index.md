# Use OpenDNS FamilyShield

UbuntuCE comes pre-configured with web content filtering powered by [CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/). In our tests [CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/) provided better protection. However, one issue that we found was the lack of a "block page" to let the user know why they can't load the page.

As an alternative you can use [OpenDNS FamilyShield](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield) instead. It does a good job of blocking most inappropriate content and comes with a nice "block page" as well.
