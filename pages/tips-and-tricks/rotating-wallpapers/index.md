# Rotating Wallpapers

UbuntuCE comes with a ton of beautiful Christian themed wallpapers.

If you can't decide which one you like best or if you just want to make your desktop a bit more dynamic you can set the wallpapers to rotate.

Right-Click on the Desktop and select `Change Background...`.

From here you can select a specific wallpaper with a small indicator in the bottom right corner. 

The image below illustrates this.

Once selected you can close the window and enjoy!
