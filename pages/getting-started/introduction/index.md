# Introduction

Ubuntu Christian Edition (UbuntuCE) is a free, open source operating system geared towards Christians. It is based on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes).

Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support.

The goal of UbuntuCE is to bring the power and security of Ubuntu to Christians.
