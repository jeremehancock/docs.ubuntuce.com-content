# Introduction

Ubuntu Christian Edition ([UbuntuCE](https://ubuntuce.com)) is a free, open source operating system geared towards Christians. It is based on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes).

Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support.

The goal of UbuntuCE is to bring the power and security of Ubuntu to Christians.

Since UbuntuCE is based directly on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS most questions are covered [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/ubuntu-help/index.html).
